# split-html-loader [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WatchBeam/split-html-loader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WatchBeam/split-html-loader)

`split-html-loader` is a webpack loader that allows conditional compilation of HTML via comment 'directives'. It's essentially a very minimalistic templating language designed specifically to 'feel' like natural HTML and to interopate fully with other templating engines and build tools. It goes along with our [split-css-loader](https://github.com/WatchBeam/split-css-loader).

For example, you can have split styling for a "desktop" and "xbox" build:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<!-- By default, comments adjust the visiblity of the following tag -->
<!-- platform: desktop -->
<p>You're on our desktop build!</p>
<!-- platform: not-mobile -->
<p>You're not on our mobile build!</p>

<!-- We also support "block" tags -->
<!-- start platform: mobile -->
  <p>This is only on mobile</p>
  <p>This is <i>still</i>only on mobile</p>
<!-- end platform: mobile -->
```

The result of building the above targeting the `mobile` platform would be:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<!-- By default, comments adjust the visiblity of the following tag -->
<!-- platform: desktop -->
<!-- 2 nodes snipped by split-html -->
<!-- platform: not-mobile -->
<!-- 2 nodes snipped by split-html -->

<!-- We also support "block" tags -->
<!-- start platform: mobile -->
  <p>This is only on mobile</p>
  <p>This is <i>still</i>only on mobile</p>
<!-- end platform: mobile -->
```

### Usage

Your `webpack.config.js` might look something like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    preLoaders: [
      { test: /\.html$/, loader: 'split-html?target=platform&value=mobile' },
    ],
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.html$/, loader: 'html' },
    ]
  }
};
```

The loader takes two parameters, the `target` specifying the key you want to compile against, and the `value` you want that key to be. In this case, we specified that we only want to compile `<!-- platform: mobile -->` and want everything else to be stripped out.

### Programmatic API

You can also use this module natively, in Node. The options are the same, you simply pass in a HTML string you want to parse:

```js
const split = require('split-html-loader');

fs.writeFileSync('./index.html', split.string(myHTML, {
  target: 'platform',
  value: 'mobile'
}));
```
